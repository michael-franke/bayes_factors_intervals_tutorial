\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

To date, the most common quantitative approach across the experimental
sciences is to run an experiment with one or more predictors and
statistically test whether the predictors affect the measured variables.
Traditionally, these statistical tests have been done within the null
hypothesis significance testing framework. Over the last decade or so,
however, we have seen more and more statistical approaches within an
alternative inferential framework: Bayesian inference. Testing
hypothesis within the Bayesian framework is often considered either
conceptually challenging, computationally too costly, or both. This
tutorial provides an accessible, non-technical introduction to Bayesian
hypothesis testing that is easy to understand and computationally cheap.

\section{Motivation and intended
audience}\label{motivation-and-intended-audience}

This tutorial provides a very basic introduction to the topic using R (R
Core Team, 2025). We wrote this tutorial with a particular reader in
mind. If you have used R before and if you have a basic understanding of
linear regression, and Bayesian inference, this tutorial is for you. We
will remain mostly conceptual to provide you with a conceptual tool to
approach hypothesis testing within Bayesian inference. The form of
hypothesis testing that we would like to introduce to you is, however,
different from the traditional null hypothesis significance testing in
that it requires more thinking about the quantitative nature of your
data. This is not a bug but, at least for us, a feature that will allow
you to understand both your data and what you can learn from them
better. This work stands on the shoulders of giants with many fantastic
resources out there. Importantly this tutorial and the accompanying
scripts will make use of a few wonderful R package:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The extraordinary \texttt{brms} package to run our Bayesian models,
  written by Paul Buerkner (2016).
\item
  The \texttt{bayestestR} package to calculate the Bayes Factors,
  written by Makowski et al.~(2019)
\item
  \ldots{}
\end{itemize}

If you don't have any experience with regression modeling, you will
probably still be able to follow, but you might also want to consider
doing a crash course. To bring you up to speed, we recommend the
excellent tutorial by Bodo Winter (2013) on mixed eï¬ects regression in a
non-Bayesian ---a.k.a. frequentist---paradigm. To then make the
transition to Bayesian versions of these regression models, we
shamelessly suggest our own tutorial on ``Bayesian Regression for
Factorial Designs'' as a natural follow-up using the same data and
Winter (Franke \& Roettger 2019). In a sense, the present tutorial on
hypothesis testing could be considered the long-awaited sequel of the
series started by Winter. For continuity, we will continue to use the
original data set.

To actively follow this tutorial, you should have R installed on your
computer (https://www.r-project.org). Unless you already have a favorite
editor for tinkering with R scripts, we recommend to try out RStudio
(https://www.rstudio.com). You will also need some packages, which you
can import with the following code:

\end{Shaded}

\section{Data, research questions \&
hypotheses}\label{data-research-questions-hypotheses}

This tutorial looks at a data set relevant for investigating whether
voice pitch diï¬ers across social contexts in Korean. Korean is a
language in which the social distance between speakers plays a central
role. The way Korean speakers speak depends for example on whether they
are in a formal context (e.g.~during a consultation with a professor) or
an informal context (e.g.~chatting with a friend about the holidays)
(e.g.~Winter et al.~2012)

To load the data into your R environment, run the following code

10 F1      F      informal  250.     27.9
# i 116 more rows
\end{verbatim}

This data set contains anonymous identifiers for individual speakers
stored in the variable \texttt{subject.} In this tutorial we will only
be looking at female speakers btw. Subjects produced diï¬erent sentences,
and the experiment manipulated whether the sentences were produced in a
\texttt{formal} or an \texttt{informal} social context, indicated by the
variable \texttt{context.} Crucially, each row contains a measurement of
pitch in Hz stored in the variable \texttt{pitch}. Here we have
calculated a derived scale (semitones) of pitch which more closely
resembles the way people perceive pitch (\texttt{pitch\_ST})

For most analyses of behavioral experiments, researchers are interested
in whether an outcome variable is meaningfully affected by at least one
manipulated variable and if so how the outcome variable is affected by
it. In this case, Winter et al.~(2012) wanted to test whether pitch is
meaningfully affected by the social context of the utterance.

As a first step, we can explore this question visually:

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{Empirical distribution of pitch values across contexts}

{\centering \includegraphics{manuscript_files/figure-pdf/descriptive-dataviz-1.pdf}

}

\end{figure}%

Figure 1 displays the pitch values for all utterances in the dataset
across contexts (semi-transparent points). The solid points indicate the
average pitch values across all sentences and speakers. Looking at the
plot, we can see that voice pitch from utterances in formal contexts are
on average slightly lower than those in informal contexts. The red
distribution is slightly shifted to the left of the blue distribution by
around 1.3 semitones. In other words, speakers tend to slightly lower
their voice pitch when speaking in a formal context. But there is also a
lot of overlap between the two contexts. Now as Bayesians, we would like
to translate the data into an expression of evidence: does the data
provide evidence for our research hypotheses?

Let us build a Bayesian linear model to approach an answer to this
question. Our first step is to specify the model formula and check which
priors need to be specified:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# define linear model formula}
\CommentTok{\# predict pitch by context and allow for that relationship }
\CommentTok{\# to vary between subjects}
\NormalTok{formula }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{bf}\NormalTok{(pitch\_ST }\SpecialCharTok{\textasciitilde{}}\NormalTok{ context }\SpecialCharTok{+}\NormalTok{ (}\DecValTok{1} \SpecialCharTok{+}\NormalTok{ context }\SpecialCharTok{|}\NormalTok{ subject))}

\CommentTok{\# get priors for this model}
\FunctionTok{get\_prior}\NormalTok{(formula, polite)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The default priors that brms picks for the Intercept and the variance
parameters are mostly reasonable as they are derived from the data,
weakly informative and symmetrical. However the prior for our critical
parameter \texttt{contextinformal} should also be weakly informative
(REFERENCE), i.e.~the prior assumption about the difference between
informal and formal contexts should be that we don't know, but our best
guess is that it is close to zero and equally likely to be more or less
than zero. So we specify a normal distribution centered on zero for this
parameter.

Note: Only for demonstration purposes, we will use default priors for
the other parameters. You always should critically reflect on all of
your priors.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# }\AlertTok{NOTE}\CommentTok{: TO MAKE IT EASIER TO FOLLOW WE COULD CONTRAST CODE THE PREDICTOR}

\CommentTok{\# pick a weakly informative prior for the critical parameter}
\NormalTok{priors }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{prior}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{normal}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{), }

                \AttributeTok{coef =} \StringTok{"contextinformal"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Now we do a so-called prior predictive check, in other words we want to
know what the posterior distribution looks like before having seen the
data, based on the priors only. This is a useful exercise to make sure
that the priors results in reasonable quantitative assumptions. We
usually do it for all parameters, but here we will focus only on the
critical parameter \texttt{contextinformal}, i.e.~the difference between
formal and informal contexts. Let us also have a look at the predictions
for the prior-only model.

\caption{Prior probability of the effect of context on pitch,
i.e.~before seeing the data}

{\centering \includegraphics{manuscript_files/figure-pdf/plot-priors-1.pdf}

}

\end{figure}%

Looking at the distribution, the priors for the effect of context on
pitch seems sensible. The most plausible value is zero. Values that are
smaller or larger than zero become less plausible the further they are
away from zero and values being smaller or larger than zero are equally
likely. Good. Before we have seen the data, our model is somewhat
pessimistic about the effect of context on on pitch. Now we can run the
full model that integrates the likelihood (our data) with the priors and
visualize the posteriors for the critical parameter.

The posterior samples suggests that the majority of plausible values
after seeing the data are positive, or in other words, informal contexts
elicit larger pitch values. Negative values are not very plausible
values, but also not completely implausible. We can visually access the
amount of of posteriors that fall on the left side of zero by relating
the dark blue part of the density curve to the yellow part. Compared to
our prior probability (green distribution) for which roughly 50\% of
posteriors were negative, this decrease in plausibility of negative
values is quite noteworthy already.

What we have done here should be quite familiar. We compare our model
predictions to a reference point. It is a single point value: zero.But
do we really care that much for such point hypotheses? Is zero really
that special? We might think so because years of using null hypothesis
significance testing has conditioned us to think that way. But this
tutorial would like to break this cycle and move forward. Bear with us
and let's approach hypothesis testing a bit differently today.

\subsection{Grounding hypotheses in regions of practical
equivalences}\label{grounding-hypotheses-in-regions-of-practical-equivalences}

NOTE NEED TO FIND A BETTER JND SOURCE

Above we claimed that we wanted to test ``whether pitch is
\textbf{meaningfully affected} by the social context of the utterance''.
We snuck the word meaningfully in there for a reason. But what does
``meaningful'' mean? This is really a good questions and (un)fortunately
requires quite a bit of thinking. This tutorial deals with speech data.
Speech is, in spoken languages at least, THE vehicle to transmit
linguistic information in order to communicate with each other. Speech
is also very complex and very noisy: Not everything that can be measured
in the acoustic signal matters for the listener. For example, if
something cannot be perceived reliably, it is at least conceivable that
it might play little to no role in communication. While speech sciences
has a rich research tradition to estimate what can and what cannot be
reliably heard, exact estimates depends on a lot of moving parts. But
there is evidence that pitch in static conditions with resynthesised
speech might be around 5\% (IsaÄenko and SchÃ¤dlich 1970). That means,
pitch changes below 0.05 semitones can not be used to discriminate two
sounds reliably. Such thresholds are referred to as Just Noticeable
Differences (JNDs) and can be used to define what constitutes meaningful
differences when we look at speech data. So we could interpret the
original hypothesis the following way: If a pitch difference is below
the JND, it is not meaningful. So instead of testing against a
point-zero hypothesis, we can test against a range of parameter values
that are equivalent to the null value for practical purposes. In our
case, let us be extra conservative and double the reported JND to 0.1,
so values between \texttt{-0.1} and \texttt{0.1} are simply meaningless.
Such ranges are called regions of practical equivalence (ROPEs,
Kruschke, 2010, 2018).

With a ROPE being defined, we can now test our hypothesis ``whether
pitch is \textbf{meaningfully affected} by the social context of the
utterance'' using Bayes Factor:

\section{Testing hypothesis using Bayes
Factor}\label{testing-hypothesis-using-bayes-factor}

\subsection{What is Bayes Factor}\label{what-is-bayes-factor}

Bayes Factors (henceforth: BFs) allow us to quantify relative evidence
of one model compared to another.

\subsection{Approximating BF with Savage
Dickey}\label{approximating-bf-with-savage-dickey}

\subsection{BF for a specified Region of Practical Equivalence
(ROPE)}\label{bf-for-a-specified-region-of-practical-equivalence-rope}

Instead of doing it by hand, we can calculate the Savage Dickey ratio
with the \texttt{bayesfactor\_parameters()} function from the
\texttt{bayesfactorR} package. What happens behind the scenes is that
the function will sample posteriors from your specified model based on
priors only (so before seeing any data) and calculates the posterior
probability of the specified \texttt{null} hypothesis (here the range
specified by our ROPE).

Before interpreting the number we get, let us visually explore what our
BF corresponds to.

pitch relative to the ROPE (-0.1, 0.1)}

{\centering \includegraphics{manuscript_files/figure-pdf/plot-ropes-1.pdf}

\end{figure}%

What the BF does is relating two numbers: (a) The prior probability of
parameter values outside the rope, i.e.~the proportion of the green
distribution that falls outside the dashed lines, and (b) the posterior
probability of parameter values outside the rope, i.e.~the proportion of
the red distribution that falls outside the dashed lines. Eye-balling
the plot, we can maybe already see that more of the red distribution is
outside the ROPE than of the green distribution.

\begin{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Bayes Factor (Null-Interval)

Parameter       |   BF
----------------------
contextinformal | 5.63

* Evidence Against The Null: [-0.100, 0.100]
\end{verbatim}

To be exact, 5.6 times for of the red distribution is outside the ROPE
than of the green distribution.

That means the model that has seen the data provide 5.6 times more
evidence for pitch being outside of the ROPE, or in other words, it is
5.6 times more likely (after having seen the data), that context affects
pitch meaningfully. According to Jeffrey's (1961) criteria for
interpreting BFs, this value corresponds to moderate evidence for the
alternative hypothesis.

Now as you probably have guessed already, all these probabilities are
very much dependent on the priors of the model, so it is important to
evaluate the robustness of our BF-based interpretation across a range of
sensible priors. And as long as we are not a 100\% sure about our ROPEs,
we might as well explore the robustness of the BF across different
ROPEs. We won't bore you with the code for that process, but you can
follow it along in our scripts. Let us assume the following five ROPE
intervals centered on zero: 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2. We assume the
following five prior values for the width of the standard deviation of
the critical parameter (centered on zero): 1 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3. These are
all sensible prior widths assuming that medium to strong effects in
either direction are plausible.

\end{figure}%

The matrix of BFs is visualized in Figure X. By comparing the BF values
along the y-axis, we can see that the calculated BFs are heavily
dependent on the chosen ROPE. We here chose theoretically quite
different ROPEs. For ROPEs above one semitone, BF values become less
stable and range from anecdotal evidence for the alternative to strong
evidence for the null hypothesis, dependent on the prior.

By comparing the BF values along the x-axis, we can see that the
calculated BFs are relatively robust for different standard deviations
of the critical prior. However, we can also see that the BF values
decrease with the width of the priors. This is not surprising and a
known phenomenon, often discussed under the Jeffreys-Lindley paradox
(Lindley 1957). The more diffuse the priors are (i.e.~wider priors), the
larger is the probability that a specific parameter values is not
compatible with the data.
