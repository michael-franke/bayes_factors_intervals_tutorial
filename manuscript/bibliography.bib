  abstract = {A key sticking point of Bayesian analysis is the choice of prior distribution, and there is a vast literature on potential defaults including uniform priors, Jeffreys' priors, reference priors, maximum entropy priors, and weakly informative priors. These methods, however, often manifest a key conceptual tension in prior modeling: a model encoding true prior information should be chosen without reference to the model of the measurement process, but almost all common prior modeling techniques are implicitly motivated by a reference likelihood. In this paper we resolve this apparent paradox by placing the choice of prior into the context of the entire Bayesian analysis, from inference to prediction to model evaluation.},

The article also discusses considerations for setting the limits of a ROPE and emphasizes that analogous considerations apply to setting the decision thresholds for p values and Bayes factors.},

  abstract = {Bayesian inference has become a standard method of analysis in many fields of science. Students and researchers in experimental psychology and cognitive science, however, have failed to take full advantage of the new and exciting possibilities that the Bayesian approach affords. Ideal for teaching and self study, this book demonstrates how to do Bayesian modeling. Short, to-the-point chapters offer examples, exercises, and computer code (using WinBUGS or JAGS, and supported by Matlab and R), with additional support available online. No advance knowledge of statistics is required and, from the very start, readers are encouraged to apply and adjust Bayesian analyses by themselves. The book contains a series of chapters on parameter estimation and model selection, followed by detailed case studies from cognitive science. After working through this book, readers should be able to build their own Bayesian models, apply the models to their own data, and draw their own conclusions.},

  abstract = {The fundamental frequency in speech shows many rapid variations, part of which determine the perceived shape of the pitch contour. This implies that the accuracy with which listeners perceive changes of F0 is more relevant to understanding the perception of intonation than the traditional just noticeable difference of F0 in speech. This study examines the sensitivity to differences in the amount of change of F0, upward (Experiment Ia) and downward (Experiment Ib). Subjects, 74 and 104, respectively, with widely different musical ability can be divided into three categories: (1) Quite a number of them were not able to discriminate differences of less than 4 semitones (nondiscriminators); (2) other subjects wrongly tried to base their judgments on a simple comparison of the final pitches of a stimulus pair (final pitch discriminators); (3) the remaining subjects (pitch distance discriminators) yielded average jnd's of about 1.5 to 2 semitones. Since the issue is associated with musical interval sense, similar experiments were carried out using piano tones. The results were essentially the same as with the speech stimuli. The outcome suggests that only differences of more than 3 semitones play a part in communicative situations.},

  abstract = {In this exploratory sociophonetic study, we investigated the properties of formal and informal speech registers in Korean. We found that in formal speech, Korean male and female speakers lowered their average fundamental frequency and pitch range. The acoustic signal furthermore exhibited overall less variability, as evidenced by decreased fundamental frequency and intensity standard deviations, and decreased period and amplitude perturbations. Differences in speech registers affected Harmonics-to-Noise-ratio and the difference between the first and second harmonic as well, suggesting breathiness-related changes, and the speech was slower and included more non-lexical fillers such as ah and oh. Unexpectedly, formality also affected breathing patterns, leading to a noticeable increase in the amount of loud ``hissing'' breath intakes in formal speech. We thus show that a variety of different means of vocal expression play a role in signaling formality in Korean. Further, we outline the implications of this study for phonetic theory and discuss our results with respect to the Frequency Code and research on clear speech.},
